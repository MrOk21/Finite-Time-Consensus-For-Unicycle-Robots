# Finite-Time-consensus-for-unicycle-robots
This project aims to implement a finite-time consensus protocol for non-holonomic ground robots. The latter should achieve the consensus and form a predefined regular shape within a finite time (rendezvous and alignment1 ). At convergence time, the agents should be at the desired pose (position and orientation) with zero velocity, avoiding the singularities. The simulation consists of a certain number of robots required to meet at an unknown rendezvous point while forming the shape of a regular polygon, as in the case of the paper by Lor`Ä±a et al.[2]. However, there are some differences with the paper mentioned: firstly, unlike the paper, which envisages exactly six unicycles, our simulation supports a variable number of them, and consequently, so does the regular polygon they generate: as many agents as there are sides from which the polygon is composed. Secondly, they are required to come into formation in a finite time. In order for them to be able to place themselves in formation in finite time, we respected what was obtained in the paper by Wang et al.[3].
