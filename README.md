# Finite-Time-consensus-for-unicycle-robots
 This project aims to implement a finite-time consensus protocol for non-holonomic ground robots. The latter should achieve the consensus and form a predefined regular shape within a finite time. At convergence time, the agents should be at the desired pose (position and orientation) with zero velocity, avoiding the singularities.
